<h1>Best 3 Movies accroding to Suman</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies or webseries of all time!</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Intersteller</h3>
<p> It's the first nolan movie i ever watched and the beauty of space exploration stands unmatched</p>
<h3>Avengers End Game</h3>
<p>The best superhero movie till date, a subtle mixture of elements of comic, thriller and saddness. A journey that started in 2008 with IronMan and ended in 2019 with him!</p>
<h3>Loki Series (Season 1 & 2)</h3>
<p>The level of character development one could get! Loki is the prime example of the line, "A Dangerous Villian can be a great HERO", and his  last line "For you, for all of us!"</p>
